A retro themed layout, built with React, styled with Tailwind and made with Vite. This was our second assignment using React in my current web development educatin. 

This page's mood is a nod toward synthwave aesthetics. To stay in theme, the post content is generated by AI, tailored to suit the vibe! 

## General approach

### Component structure
This app has four levels of components (not counting main.jsx), with App.jsx at the top. As the project grew, I made sure to break it down into smaller, manageable parts. While there's a bit of prop drilling going on, I also implemented useContext to pass data more cleanly in some places. In hindsight, it may not have been strictly necessary, but I saw it as an opportunity to learn and experiment.

## Features

- Responsive design with Tailwind

- Four-level component structure with React

- useState, useEffect, and useContext for state handling

- A sprinkle of prop drilling

- Retro design with modern tech

- Built with Vite

  ## Reflection
  Even if useContext might have been overkill, it was a good learning opportunity and gave me insight into how it works in practice.
  
  Tailwind made it easier to rapidly prototype and iterate on the design, directly into the components keeping external CSS to a minimum. I found it to be well suited for the paradigm.
